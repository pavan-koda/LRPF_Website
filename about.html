                <p><strong>Founded on: January 1, 2020</strong></p>
                <p>The Legal Rights Protection Forum (LRPF) is a non-profit organization dedicated to upholding India's constitutional framework, national security, and legal integrity. We are a team of passionate legal and social activists, lawyers, and researchers who operate on the frontlines of legal activism.</p>
                
                <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                <p>Our mission is to build a lawful, transparent, and secure India by holding organizations and individuals accountable for violations of national law. We believe in empowering citizens with the knowledge and tools they need to protect their rights and contribute to a more just and secure society.</p>
                
                <h3>Our Work</h3>
                <p>At the Legal Rights Protection Forum (LRPF), our work is centered on addressing critical issues that affect India's legal, social, and national fabric. Our dedicated team of experts focuses on the following key areas to ensure accountability and uphold the rule of law.Through strategic legal action, public awareness campaigns, and investigative reporting, LRPF works to expose and prevent activities that threaten India's sovereignty and its citizens' rights.</p>
                
                <h3>Child Rights</h3>
                <p>We are dedicated to the protection of children and their fundamental rights. Our efforts focus on combating issues such as child labor, trafficking, and abuse. We work to ensure that legal provisions designed to protect children are effectively enforced, and we advocate for policies that create a safer environment for them to grow and thrive.</p>
                
                <h3>Human Rights</h3>
                <p>LRPF is committed to upholding the basic human rights guaranteed to every individual under the Constitution of India and international law. We take action against violations of human rights, including discrimination, unlawful detention, and social injustice. Our work involves legal intervention and public advocacy to ensure that justice is served and that the dignity of every citizen is respected.</p>
                
                <h3>Financial Accountability and FCRA Compliance</h3>
                <p>We are committed to ensuring financial transparency, especially concerning foreign funding. We actively investigate and file formal complaints with government authorities regarding the misuse of foreign funds. Our work targets violations of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA), a crucial law that regulates the acceptance and utilization of foreign contributions by individuals and associations in India. By monitoring compliance and reporting violations, we help prevent these funds from being used for purposes that are detrimental to India's interests.</p>
                
                <h3>Protecting National Security</h3>
                <p>National security is a cornerstone of our work. We closely monitor suspicious activities that are backed by foreign entities and have the potential to destabilize the nation. By highlighting these threats to the appropriate authorities and the public, we aim to prevent actions that could compromise India's sovereignty and internal security. Our focus is on proactive intervention to counter foreign-backed agendas that pose a risk to the country.</p>
                
                <h3>Addressing Illegal Encroachments</h3>
                <p>The unlawful seizure and occupation of public land and unauthorized construction projects are a significant challenge. These illegal encroachments often lead to a loss of public resources and can disrupt urban planning and environmental balance. We work to expose these activities and advocate for legal action to reclaim public property and restore order. Our efforts help ensure that public spaces are protected for the benefit of all citizens.</p>
                
                <h3>Empowering Citizens Through Legal Activism</h3>
                <p>A well-informed citizenry is the most effective defense against legal and social injustices. We believe in empowering people with knowledge about their rights and the laws of the land. Our team conducts a variety of educational initiatives, including training camps and workshops on legal activism, awareness drives, and training programs. These programs are designed to help citizens understand their constitutional rights and national laws, enabling them to identify illegal activities and take informed action.</p>
                
                <h3>Leveraging Social and Digital Activism</h3>
                <p>In today’s connected world, digital platforms are powerful tools for change. We use social media and targeted digital campaigns to raise awareness about our mission and the issues we fight for. By engaging the public online, we can mobilize support, share our findings, and create a powerful collective voice against legal and social injustices. This approach helps us reach a broader audience and build a community dedicated to upholding the rule of law.</p>
