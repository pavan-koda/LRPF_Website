                        <p>We are committed to ensuring financial transparency, especially concerning foreign funding. We actively investigate and file formal complaints with government authorities regarding the misuse of foreign funds. Our work targets violations of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA), a crucial law that regulates the acceptance and utilization of foreign contributions by individuals and associations in India. By monitoring compliance and reporting violations, we help prevent these funds from being used for purposes that are detrimental to India's interests.</p>

                        <p>National security is a cornerstone of our work. We closely monitor suspicious activities that are backed by foreign entities and have the potential to destabilize the nation. By highlighting these threats to the appropriate authorities and the public, we aim to prevent actions that could compromise India's sovereignty and internal security. Our focus is on proactive intervention to counter foreign-backed agendas that pose a risk to the country.</p>

                        <p>The unlawful seizure and occupation of public land and unauthorized construction projects are a significant challenge. These illegal encroachments often lead to a loss of public resources and can disrupt urban planning and environmental balance. We work to expose these activities and advocate for legal action to reclaim public property and restore order. Our efforts help ensure that public spaces are protected for the benefit of all citizens.</p>
